Plot the 3D trajectory of a body or marker for the entire duration of recording

 - look at the bodyIDs parsed using importVicon
 - pass a list of strings present in the bodyID of choice, through the parameter include
 - pass a list of strings that should be absent from the bodyID of choice, through the parameter exclude
