# Comprehensive Installation

These installation instructions are for first time users of YARP and specifically for compiling from sources in a linux environment. The instructions for installing YARP can be found [here](http://wiki.icub.org/wiki/Linux:Installation_from_sources) and are repeated here for completeness. For any problems please check the official instructions.

## Install YARP

set up the required environment variables. 

We will assume that you are installing YARP in the directory $PROJECTS - for example this could be your home directory. Use your favourite text editor to open ~/.bashrc and add the following lines:

* export YARP_ROOT=$PROJECTS/yarp
* export YARP_DIR=$YARP_ROOT/build
* export ICUBcontrib_DIR=$PROJECTS/icub-contrib-install
* export YARP_DATA_DIRS=$YARP_DIR/share/yarp:$ICUBcontrib_DIR/share/ICUBcontrib
* export PATH=$PATH:$YARP_DIR/bin:$ICUBcontrib_DIR/bin

replace $PROJECTS with your desired directory.

get all dependencies

> sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://www.icub.org/ubuntu xenial contrib/science" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/icub.list'

> sudo apt update 

> sudo apt install icub-common

get the repositories

> git clone https://github.com/robotology/yarp.git

> git clone https://github.com/robotology/icub-contrib-common.git

> git clone https://github.com/robotology/event-driven.git

build the repositories

> cd $YARP_ROOT

> mkdir build && cd build

> ccmake ..

set the following variables, pressing [c] to configure until all options are shown:

* CREATE_GUIS ON
* CREATE_LIB_MATH ON
* CREATE_YARPDATADUMPER ON
* CREATE_YARPDATAPLAYER ON
* CREATE_YARPLOGGER ON
* CREATE_YARPMANAGER ON
* CREATE_YARPSCOPE ON
* CREATE_YARPVIEW ON

if you are using the icub robot also turn on:

* CREATE_YARPMOTORGUI ON
* CREATE_YARPROBOTINTERFACE ON

finally press [g] to generate the makefile.

> make -j4

> cd ../..

> icub-contrib-common

> mkdir build && cd build

> ccmake ..

set the following variables

* CMAKE_INSTALL_DIR=$ICUBcontrib_DIR

press [c] to configure and [g] to generate

> make install -j4

> cd ../..

> cd event-driven

> mkdir build && cd build

> ccmake ..

set the following variables, pressing [c] to configure until all options are shown:

* BUILD_PROCESSING ON
* BUILD_APPLICATIONS ON

select any of the applications you want to build by setting them to ON. If you need to interface to hardware (e.g. using the zynqGrabber), please also set:

* BUILD_PROCESSING ON

and select which modules you need. Press [g] to generate the makefile.

> make install -j4

completed.

## Install icub-main (optional)

This is only needed if you are going to work with an icub robot and is not needed if you want to use the event-driven library as a stand-alone project.

Add the following environment variables (e.g. in ~/.bashrc):

* export ICUB_ROOT=$PROJECTS/icub-main
* export ICUB_DIR=$ICUB_ROOT/build
* export YARP_DATA_DIRS=$YARP_DATA_DIRS:$ICUB_DIR/share/icub
* export PATH=$PATH:$ICUB_DIR/bin

in the $PROJECTS directory

> git clone https://github.com/robotology/icub-main.git

> cd icub-main

> mkdir build && cd build

> ccmake ..

set the following variables, pressing [c] to configure until all options are shown:

* ENABLE_icubmod_cartesiancontrollerclient ON
* ENABLE_icubmod_cartesiancontrollerserver ON
* ENABLE_icubmod_gazecontrollerclient ON

finally press [g] to generate.

> make -j4

completed

## Test Installation

To test your installation is correct please follow the "Getting started with the viewer" tutorial [here](http://robotology.github.io/event-driven/doxygen/doc/html/pages.html).
